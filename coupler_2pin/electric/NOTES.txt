Desired features:
	- Dust tolerant
		- Built around existing robust connectors, like Anderson power poles?
		- Orient connectors vertically, so dust falls out.
	- Ideally androgynous, to allow:
		- Tool-to-robot
		- Robot-to-charger
		- Tool-to-charger
		- Robot-to-robot
	- High power, up to kW at 28VDC to allow 1C charging of a 1kWh robot or tool battery. 
		- 1 kW / 28 VDC = 35 amps sustained
		- Use 45A rated Anderson power poles




Electrically, I should have:
	Alignment pins
	Heavy amp connection for tools / battery recharge
		Maybe 75A Andersons?
	I2C digital comms: gnd, 5v, SDA, SCL
		Maybe as Andersons, for mech robustness?
